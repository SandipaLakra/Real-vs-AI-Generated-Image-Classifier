Detecting AI-Generated Images with Precision!

In an era where authenticity is paramount, this endeavor delved into the realm of AI-generated imagery, aiming to enhance trust and transparency.In this project I trained an image classification model to discern between real and AI-generated images

**Key Highlights**:
- Leveraged the CIFAKE dataset containing both real and synthetically-generated images.
- Utilized TensorFlow for model training, powered by a T4 GPU.
- Implemented data augmentation techniques to enrich dataset diversity.
- Customized a ResNet50 base for optimal performance in discerning real from AI-generated images.
- Achieved impressive results with a precision of 94.9%, recall of 89.2%, and an overall accuracy of 92%.

**What Stood Out**:
- Model adaptation to tackle overfitting through meticulous fine-tuning and augmentation strategies.
- Emphasis on robustness, ensuring the model generalizes effectively to unseen data.

**Challenges & Learnings**:
- Combatting overfitting through iterative refinement.
- Balancing precision and recall to ensure a well-rounded classification approach.

 **Future Outlook**:
- Continuing to explore advancements in AI and image classification for real-world applications.
- Striving for models that not only excel in accuracy but also in generalization and real-world applicability.
